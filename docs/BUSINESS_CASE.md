# Background Information

In the world of crypto, airdrops are a popular way to encourage early adoption for new protocols.

Airdrops are allocations of token for a protocol that are sent as a reward for early involvement or contributions made to a project. The provide the potential for a future incentive that projects can tease to get their first users.

One of the key aspects of airdrops is meeting certain requirements to qualify to receive these bonuses. These may sometimes including trading on a platform, connecting a wallet, or depositing a certain balance. At times, it's difficult to spot these opportunities early on and qualify for rewards before distributions are determined and sent.

# Monetary Upside and Rationale

In the past, my friends and I have collectively received over $200,000 in airdrops. This is in large part due to being early to new protocols set to offer these rewards as well as through referrals.

Users that are active within the crypto currency community are often open to trying new products and getting in early to receive rewards. Oftentimes some of these protocols will also give referral benefits in exchange for onboarding new users.

Several companies specifically focused on airdrops have been acquired by 10 figure projects to help them with their distribution, proving that the data aggregation has a true use case to both the community end user and to a potential acquirer.

# Specific Business Use Case

1. Referrals -> Extra Airdrops
   By accessing this consistent data, we can onboard other users to these protocols using our referral information. One example of this that has personally served me well was for the Grass project where referral bonuses can lead to big increase in airdrop rewards. We give end users the value of staying on top of airdrops with in depth information (such as risk, time left, etc) and in return get their referral benefits which can sometimes lead to 7 figures in bonuses in some cases.
2. Airdrop Farming
   Another tactic that we can use this scraper for is airdrop farming. By automating the data collection process for finding new airdrops and their potential payouts, we can target specific projects that we'd like to farm. This process includes usings scripts to automate wallet creation and engage with the protocol. By knowing the exact qualifications nad steps, risk level, and time left to engage, airdrop farmers gain a significant advantage when it comes to being first to both accurately and swiftly accumulate points. Timing here matters significantly as the earliest adopters often receive the most rewards.
3. Paid Channel Subscriptions and Content
   Another popular way to monetize airdrops is through paid alpha channels on Telegram or Discord. These are popular where leaders of groups help use scripts to scrape and pre-vet potential offers. With this technique users would pay us to access this in depth information as soon it releases or be notified when they're running out of time to engage in a project or when either an airdrop is confirmed to be happening or not. Again, many alpha channels doing this exact thing have been very successful, sometimes raking in millions in earnings.
