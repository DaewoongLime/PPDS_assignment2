# Background Information

In the world of crypto, airdrops are a popular way to encourage early adoption for new protocols.

Airdrops are allocations of tokens for a protocol that are sent as a reward for early involvement or contributions made to a project. They provide the potential for future incentives that projects can use to attract their first users.

One of the key aspects of airdrops is meeting certain requirements to qualify for these bonuses. These may include trading on a platform, connecting a wallet, or depositing a certain balance. At times, it can be difficult to spot these opportunities early and qualify for rewards before distributions are determined.

# Monetary Upside and Rationale

In the past, my friends and I have collectively received over **$200,000** in airdrops. This was largely due to being early to new protocols set to offer rewards, as well as through referrals.

Crypto users are often open to trying new products and getting in early to receive rewards. Many protocols also give referral benefits in exchange for onboarding new users.

Several companies focused specifically on airdrops have been acquired by 10-figure projects to help with distribution. This proves that **data aggregation has real value** both for end users and as an acquisition target.


# Specific Business Use Case


1. **Referrals → Extra Airdrops**  
   - Accessing consistent data allows us to onboard users with referral information.  
   - Example: Grass project referrals significantly boosted airdrop rewards.  
   - Value to end users: stay on top of airdrops with details like risk, time left, and requirements.  

2. **Airdrop Farming**  
   - Automating the collection of new airdrop data (qualifications, steps, risk level, time left).  
   - Allows targeted farming strategies (e.g., automating wallet creation and engagement).  
   - Being early matters — earliest adopters often receive the most rewards.  

3. **Paid Channel Subscriptions & Content**  
   - Monetization through private Telegram or Discord alpha channels.  
   - Users pay to access early, vetted information and deadline reminders.  
   - Proven model: many alpha groups generate millions in earnings.
