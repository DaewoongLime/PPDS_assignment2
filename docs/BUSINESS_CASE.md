# Background Information

In the world of crypto, airdrops are a popular way to encourage early adoption for new protocols.

Airdrops are allocations of token for a protocol that are sent as a reward for early involvement or contributions made to a project. The provide the potential for a future incentive that projects can tease to get their first users.

One of the key aspects of airdrops is meeting certain requirements to qualify to receive these bonuses. These may sometimes including trading on a platform, connecting a wallet, or depositing a certain balance. At times, it's difficult to spot these opportunities early on and qualify for rewards before distributions are determined and sent.

# Monetary Upside and Rationale

In the past, my friends and I have collectively received over $200,000 in airdrops. This is in large part due to being early to new protocols set to offer these rewards as well as through referrals.

Users that are active within the crypto currency community are often open to trying new products and getting in early to receive rewards. Oftentimes some of these protocols will also give referral benefits in exchange for onboarding new users.
